# The Trillo Project:

I had a very good experience of what I can do using pure Css in this big project. When I started my project, I started with pure Css, then I completed my project by converting everything to my sass code. The biggest reason for this is that as the number of Css codes increases, it becomes really difficult to control my project and I can overcome this difficulty with Sass. There are 2 things that I understand very clearly from this project: First, I can create great designs using pure css, and second, I can write these designs using sass with the least code, in the fastest and most readable way.
